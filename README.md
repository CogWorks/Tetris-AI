# How to install this python package (named "cogworks"), via pip, directly from git

1. If you have do not have it, install git.
  1.1 git needs to be in PATH, which is automatically done while installing git with default options
  
2. In CMD, run this command.
    pip install git+https://github.com/CogWorks/Tetris-AI
    
    Cursory explanation of the syntax: pip install git+link_to_the_git_page
