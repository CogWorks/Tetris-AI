Want to run a new model? Here's what to do!

Screen-ception.


1. Connect to the cwl-projects server under your account.

    $ ssh [your_rcs_id]@cwl-projects.cogsci.rpi.edu
    

2. If you haven't before, clone the simulator repository.

    $ git clone git@github.com:CogWorks/Tetris-AI
    
    or, if that fails, clone the read-only version
    
    $ git clone http://www.github.com/CogWorks/Tetris-AI
    
2.1 If you HAVE already cloned the project, 
    pull the newest version.
    
    $git pull
    
3. Now to run it.
    You'll want to set-and-forget, right? So use Screen!
    
    Start a new Screen session.
    $ screen -S [model_name]
    
4. Run your current AI model 
    (after editing the file particulars; 
    turn off all score reporting).
    
    $cd Tetris-AI
    $python simulator.py
    
5. Now it's running to its heart's content.
    But you have shit to do. Disconnect from the screen...
    
    Press [CTRL] + [A], then [D]
    
5.1 Oh god, it's gone! What have I done?! Check on the screen.

    show the list of the current screens.
    $ screen -ls
    
    and to log back into a running screen...
    $ screen -r [model_name]
    
6. Exit out, and be done with it. The screen 
    will continue running on the remote server ad infinitum.
    You can disconnect completely.
    
    From the ssh session:
    $ exit 
    
    
7. When the model dies, which it surely will, and you're done
    make SURE to log back into the server, 
    enter the screen session,
    and terminate it.
    
    If the program is still running and you want to end it.
        press [CTRL] + [C]
    
    To exit the screen:
    $ exit
    
    Check to make sure no screen sessions are running:
    $ screen -ls
    
    
    If no models are running, 
    and no screen sessions are persistent, 
    you're in the clear.
    
To save output files to a Workspace folder on the server:
    Ex: Saving output files to the Two-Step Workspace folder in the Tetris project:
    (in cross_entropy.py)
    
    if not os.path.exists("/CogWorks/cwl-data/Active_Projects/Tetris/Workspaces/Two-Step/runs"):
        os.makedirs("/CogWorks/cwl-data/Active_Projects/Tetris/Workspaces/Two-Step/runs")
    outfile = open("/CogWorks/cwl-data/Active_Projects/Tetris/Workspaces/Two-Step/runs/" + args.output_file + ".incomplete.tsv", "w")
